Description: Matrix spectral estimators shrink the singular values of a data
  matrix while keeping the singular vectors unchanged. Higher-order spectral
  estimators (HOSE) are generalizations of these matrix estimators to tensors.
  HOSEs usually contain tuning parameters that must be chosen by the user. This
  package provides methods to calculate these HOSEs and choose these tuning
  parameters by minimizing an unbiased estimate of the mean squared error.
