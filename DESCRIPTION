Description: Implements the higher-order spectral estimators (HOSE's)
  of Gerard and Hoff (2017) <doi:10.1214/17-EJS1330>. Matrix spectral
  estimators shrink the singular values of a data matrix while keeping
  the singular vectors unchanged.  HOSE's are generalizations of these
  matrix estimators to tensors.  HOSE's usually contain tuning
  parameters that must be chosen by the user. This package provides
  methods to calculate these HOSE's and choose these tuning parameters
  by minimizing an unbiased estimate of the mean squared error.  The
  main functions are get_c(), tensor_var_est(), and soft_coord().
